## Categories
Currently supported for the Any% category. Planned categories include:
 * Savior
 * All Coins

## Missing Features
We are still trying to add more features, to make up for other categories:
 * Splitting on savior
 * Checking for shards
   * To make sure to split when you actually beat a level, as opposed to if you don't get the shard but exit anyway.
